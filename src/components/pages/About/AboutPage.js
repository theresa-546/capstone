  Food Bio is inspired by research on the question of, How can 
  consumers make judgments about the freshness of food in an 
  online environment? The creation and concept of Food Bio is a 
  solution among many, to ensure food quality and food safety for
  sumers. 
<br></br><br></br>
The concept is derived from blockchain traceability which 
makes it possible to track the origins of food without the worry 
of tampered data. This creates a trustworthy and transparent 
environment for both consumer and producers.</p>
